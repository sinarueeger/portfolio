Example illustration for region #2 (74 regions in total)
This graph illustrates the weights chosen by each of the three methods among population specific variants in region #2. The x-axis represents the fraction of Finnish individuals in the reference panel (0 to 1 in 0.05 increments), and the y-axis shows the standardised function values: in black the MSE of the imputation (w∗) and the green and the blue line indicate the function values of variance matching (w_VM) and Adapt-Mix(w_AM), respectively. For a given fraction of Finnish in the GWAS and a given reference panel size, the minimum (marked with a dot), is the lowest MSE that we can achieve. Here we show the simulation results for 20%, 60% and 80% Finnish individuals in the GWAS population (w+ = {0.2,0.6,0.8}) and a reference panel size n of 500, 5′000 and 12′500 (indicated in columns w.target.facet and rows n.ref). The vertical dotted line represents the true fraction of Finnish individuals (w+).
