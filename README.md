# Portfolio

Code and visualisation examples.

## Code

- [Code snippet from a current project](code/drugbank2dfr.R) 
- [R-file](code/power_calc.R) to calculate power for a set of SNPs.
- [R-file] to produce a **map** that contains the 1000 genomes populations](https://github.com/sinarueeger/map-1000genomes)
- [GWAS.utils package](https://github.com/sinarueeger/GWAS.utils) is a simple **R-package** with a few functions and two datasets.
- [Code snippet](code/drugbank2dfr.R) to turn [drugbank](https://www.drugbank.ca/) data into a dataframe.

## Visualisations

A selection of visualisations is grouped into two categories:

- [Infographics](infoviz/): illustrating a concept.
- [Data visualisations](dataviz/): illustrating data.

Additionally, you can scroll through my [theses](theses/) or the [PhD defense slides](https://sinarueeger.github.io/publicdefense/slides#1).
